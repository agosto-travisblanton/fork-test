<p>This command wipes Provisioning data from the player including the device key, API key, GCM registration id, and
  pairing code (everything that is not a file).
  Common usage: This command is used If we think there is something wrong with the device representation for a Player
  and we want it to go back to Provisioning to get new device representation. For example, if we want to move a device
  from one environment to another because it was misconfigured, we send this command. It causes the player to go back to
  Provisioning to get all new data including a device key (which may be under a new tenant).</p>
