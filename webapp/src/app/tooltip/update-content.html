<p>This command instructs the device to check for new content.
  Common usage: Used mostly by dev but will be more useful in Production now that we have a configurable check content
  interval. Currently, the player checks for new content every 60 seconds. In order to reduce these checks where
  possible, we’ve added a “check for new content” setting to the device in Provisioning. The player will now poll for
  new content at the interval set in Provisioning. If we want the device to check for new content off schedule/in
  between intervals, we use this command.</p>
