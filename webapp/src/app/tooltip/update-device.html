<p>This command instructs the player to request a new device representation from Provisioning.
  Common usage: When someone updates device settings in Provisioning (e.g., time zone setting or “check for new content”
  interval), Provisioning sends this command so the Player knows to get its new settings. This will force the device to
  restart.</p>
