<p>This command removes all the cached content from a player, which requires the player to download all new content
  (wipes out all files).
  Common usage: This is used by the application to force a player to get new content when it first starts up so it
  doesnâ€™t look for files locally. If a device gets too full, we would use this command to clear it."</p>
