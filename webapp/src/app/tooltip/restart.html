<p>This command restarts the player application (unmanaged) or reboots the device (managed/kiosk mode).
  Common usage: This command can be used to force the device to get a new version of the application or to get a new
  version of the OS. Prior to having a Check for Update command, this was used to force the player to get a new device
  representation.
